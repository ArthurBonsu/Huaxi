This is the project with next js and truffle and as seen in the project tree. I am trying to develop a coin for a hospital where the patients make request and they will send to the doctors. Due to the queue they have the doctor has to deny patients but will only do so if the patient pays a certain amount with the coin and send the transaction. We have built the various pages for the doctor and the patient in component with the names signifying what they do. I have a set of contracts in contracts, but since we are taking from an old projects some of the names are still old, we will need to change it. Overall getting from an old project i want to rewrite the old project to take on this work. so you will help me rewrite the codes. I wil give you a sample of the old project so that you have an idea of the ways to rewrite everything
